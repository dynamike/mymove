# How to Test Prime API on staging and experimental

## Overview

In order to properly test the Prime API, you will need the ability to access it on staging and experimental.

## Requirements

You will first have to complete steps to create CAC [access](https://github.com/transcom/mymove/blob/master/docs/how-to/use-mtls-with-cac.md).


Additionally, those changes must be deployed to each environment. Merging to master will deploy to Staging. But you need to explicitly deploy to Experimental to get access there, otherwise you won't have access.

## Prerequisites

Download DoD certificates:

1. Go to this military CAC [website](https://militarycac.com/macnotes.htm#which_exact_CAC).
2. If you are a Safari or Chrome user scroll down to step 5.
3. If you are a Firefox user scroll down to step 5a.
4. Download the required files.
5. Confirm in Keychain on your Mac that you have all the certificates.
6. There will likely be a few certs that your Mac won't trust. You will need to manually enable `Always Trust` for these certificates.

## Testing Prime API

1. If testing on staging, run this command:

    ```sh
    go run ./cmd/prime-api-client --cac --hostname api.staging.move.mil --port 443
    ```

2. If testing on experimental, run this command:

    ```sh
    go run ./cmd/prime-api-client --cac --hostname api.experimental.move.mil --port 443
    ```

3. You will be prompted to enter your CAC pin. This will be the same pin you created when picking up your CAC.

4. If successful you should receive a response similar to:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "createdAt": "2020-01-22",
        "id": "5d4b25bb-eb04-4c03-9a81-ee0398cb7791",
        "isAvailableToPrime": true,
        "isCanceled": false,
        "moveOrderID": "6fca843a-a87e-4752-b454-0fac67aa4981",
        "mto_service_items": [{ ... }],
        "mto_shipments": [{ ... }],
        "payment_requests": [],
        "reference_id": "1234-4321",
        "updatedAt": "2020-01-22"
      }
    ]
    ```
